A website based Git ,in other words, a version control repository serviced by an online 
hosting over the internet is what we know as GitHub. GitHub is the most popular tool for
sharing code with co-workers, friends or any group. While there have always been alternatives
to GitHub like Bitbucket,Sourceforge,Google Cloud Source Repositories but GitHub has always 
proven easy and simple to use,hence chosen by wider group of people.

The push command in git helps in uploading whatever local repositories we have created , changes
made or worked under ,to remote-repository. Remote repository refers to the online copy of our local
repository on any of git platforms like github and bitbucket. Using Push also helps us in uploading new
commits to the remote repository and also update old commits with new. However it should be taken extra 
care while pushing because pushing can overwrite changes which may cause problems .

Since git helps in co-operation and providing collaborative environment, its not new concept that several
individuals work under the same source code. In most of the cases , people share and do tasks according to
their own expertise and merge the splitted work into one. Branching enables every developer/coder in the
team to branch out from the original-main branch and work with their own, later when all of the branches
are complete they can easily merge later on.

In this project, we created a remote rempository on github and gave perission to everyone in the team. We created
a master branch with the code-base for every member. Then we branched out to our own individual branches in order to work
on our own part. When the work was completed we merged all of our individual branches into one master branch with the 
help of the team leader.
