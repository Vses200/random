To put it another way, agile testing refers to software testing that follows these agile development techniques. Agile testing begins early in the project and continues through development and integration. Agile testing, on the other hand, does not begin until after the development process has began with agile methodology. Between several best-practices, there are two forms of testing that should be examined, keeping the project's nature in mind. They are TDD (Test-Driven-Development) and BDD (Build-Driven-Development). Both models were used in our research.
